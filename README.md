## Project Target
Evolve the local rule of a CA to conform to a given behavior. In other words, given a target matrix which could have a certain shape/pattern/configuration, evolve the CA rules in order to get the output matrix as similar to the target matrix.

The inspiration for this project came from the very well known game [Conway's Game of Life.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
